                <h2>Herb Safety</h2>
                <p>
                    The first, and most crucial step in preparing Chinese herbal medicine is verifying that 
                    all the herbs being used are safe for consumption. In the past, some Chinese herbal supplements
                    have been reported to cause damages to the body. A major cause of such damages is the existence 
                    of harmful substances in certain herbs. For example, aristolochic acid is a component of the 
                    Chinese herb Guan Mu Tong, which was used by some manufacturers to make the Chinese herbal medicine 
                    Long Dan Xie Gan Wan before its detrimental effect on the Kidneys was found. As we know, Guan Mu Tong
                    is not the only herb that contains aristolochic acid, and aristolochic acid is not the only toxic 
                    substance found in herbs. Therefore, a deep scientific knowledge is necessary to exclude the use 
                    of the herbs that contain aristolochic acid or any other harmful constituent. At ActiveHerb, every 
                    herb has been carefully evaluated for its safety by our experts before it can be used in our product lines.
                </p>
                <h3 class="center">
                    Each and every ActiveHerb and Guang Ci Tang product has to pass this
                    comprehensive set of lab tests before it reaches consumers.

                    <h2>Herb Sourcing and Authentication</h2>
                    <p>
                        Procurement of premium quality Chinese herbs is the foundation of making quality Chinese medicine. The 
                        quality of Chinese herbs available in the market varies greatly, depending on many factors, including 
                        indigenous soils, growing practices, harvesting techniques, and in some instances, counterfeit and 
                        adulteration by unscrupulous merchants. That is why ActiveHerb chooses to partner with only the most 
                        respected herbal medicine manufacturers in China. We insist on purchasing high quality Chinese herbs that 
                        meet our requirement for authenticity, quality grade, potency, and safety, no matter what higher purchase 
                        prices we have to pay. As many herbs look alike, authentication is needed to ensure the correct species 
                        is purchased. Identity tests done by our experienced herbalists include basic organoleptic, microscopy, 
                        and Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), adhering to the official PRC Pharmacopoeia and other recognized references.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some Chinese herbs need to be properly processed before use to achieve the desired medicinal properties or to 
                        eliminate toxicity, which is also a topic of quality assurance. Quality control measures at this stage include 
                        testing of active ingredients using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to ensure potency, and testing 
                        of pollutants like heavy metals to ensure purity.

                    <h2>Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)</h2>
                    <p>
                        All of our herbal supplements are manufactured in strict 
                        compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) in 
                        both China and America. The facilities of our Chinese 
                        partners are cGMP-certified for pharmaceutical products. 
                        cGMP refers to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice 
                        regulations enforced by the US Food and Drug Administration 
                        (FDA) cGMP dictates standards for everything from facility 
                        cleanliness, employee training, process documentation, 
                        and more to ensure proper design, monitoring, and control 
                        of manufacturing processes and facilities. cGMP also includes 
                        standards for process transparency and traceability to quickly 
                        track down anomalies and answer regulator inquiries on demand. 
                        This high level of scrutiny and care results in a product that
                        is handled safely and hygienically. These standards are in place 
                        through every step of the process, starting from herb procurement, 
                        all the way to the finished product.

                <p>
                    We deploy our proprietary technology in the manufacturing of our extraordinarily 
                    concentrated herbal products. Each product has its own product specifications that 
                    cover its manufacturing protocol and quality control parameters. Our quality control 
                    standards meet and often exceed those set forth in the Pharmacopoeia of the People’s 
                    Republic of China and the US Pharmacopoeia (USP) for similar products. For example, 
                    safe heavy metal levels set in USP for botanical drugs are 10 ppm (parts per million) 
                    for Lead, 3 ppm for Arsenic, Mercury, and Cadmium respectively. Our rigorous quality 
                    control procedures allow us to keep our heavy metal limits below 3 ppm for Lead and 
                    Arsenic, 0.5 ppm for Mercury and Cadmium.

                <h2>Heavy Metal Limits Standards</h2>
                <p>
                    Extensive laboratory tests are carried throughout the manufacturing process to ensure 
                    such quality standards are met. Testing is done both in our state-of-the-art quality 
                    control center and 3rd party laboratories. Upon finishing, each and every batch of 
                    products is subject to a complete set of tests for safety, purity and consistency. 
                    These tests include physical examination on the appearance and uniformity, moisture 
                    content, weight consistency, disintegration time, heavy metals, and microbial loads. 
                    Tests for active ingredients and pesticides are also performed as necessary. Only the 
                    finished batches that meet all the specifications are accepted to our warehouse. Our 
                    Certificate of Analysis, offered with each product, attests to the safety and purity 
                    of our products.
