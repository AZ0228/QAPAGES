                <h2>Formulation</h2>
                <p>
                    Chinese herbal formulas play a central role in the theory and practices of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Many formulas were invented one thousand years ago and remain widely used today as an integral part of China's national healthcare system. These classics are truly time-tested for safety and effectiveness. We are proud to inherit these treasures and feel honored to share them with you.
                    As our society faces many modern health challenges, Chinese medicine is constantly evolving to combat them. Our team of scientists and TCM doctors stay abreast of the newest research and breakthrough in both TCM and modern biosciences. Then we incorporate that newfound knowledge into the development of our signature formulas that address many contemporary health issues.
                    Guang Ci Tang currently offers over 100 Chinese herbal formulas.                </p>

                <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
                <p>
                    To meet our strict quality standards, Guang Ci Tang® products are manufactured in collaboration with some of the largest and best pharmaceutical companies in China, in state-of-the-art cGMP certified facilities. Only premium quality Chinese herbs are used. The botanical identity of each herb is verified by our expert professional staff based on the accepted standards set forth in the Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to ensure authenticity, quality, potency, and safety. Furthermore, many Chinese herbs must be processed in highly specific ways to achieve the desired medicinal properties or to eliminate toxicity. At ActiveHerb, we take care to perform these preparations in accordance with the TCM tradition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to produce Guang Ci Tang® tablets, herbs are first thoroughly cleaned, then mixed together and extracted in water in a steel extraction tank. This process follows the ancient practice of decocting Chinese herbs in a pot, but allows precise control over the extracting temperature and time. The modern extraction process reproduces the traditional method to recover active ingredients, but has been shown to yield a superior degree of potency. Essential oils, which typically evaporate from the herbs during heating, are automatically recovered through the extraction process. After extraction, herb residues are discarded while the extraction liquid is recovered and pumped into a condenser. Here, the remaining water is evaporated, leaving a highly concentrated paste. This paste is turned into tablets or teapills by adding a small amount of dry powdered herbs from the original herbal formula. In this way, we avoid the use of unnecessary binders and ensure the purity of our products.

                <h2>5:1 Concentration</h2>
                <p>
                    The standard PRC Pharmacopoeia procedure for producing concentrated Chinese herbal pills is based on a concentration of 2:1, meaning that 2g of raw herbs will yield 1g of finished pills. These pills weigh about 180mg each. Each dose requires 8 pills, which weighs 1.44g total and is equal to 3g of raw herbs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Guang Ci Tang® strives to be the most potent and effective Chinese medicine available. We developed proprietary extraction and concentration technology that allows us to make our tablets and pills at a final concentration of 5:1, meaning 1 gram of tablets or pills is equal to 5 grams of raw herbs. As each Guang Ci Tang® tablet or pill weighs 200mg, each pill is equal to 1 gram of raw herbs. This is the highest concentration available for Chinese medicine pills and tablets, and is more than double the concentration of standard pills from other leading brands of Chinese medicine. As a result, patients are able to reduce the number of pills required per dose by half to achieve the same powerful effect.

                <h2>Value</h2>
                <p>
                    Guang Ci Tang® Chinese medicine offers excellent value at affordable prices. Each bottle contains 200 tablets or pills at a 5:1 concentration. Each tablet or pill is therefore equal to 1 gram of raw herbs. One Guang Ci Tang® bottle contains the equivalent of 200g of raw herbs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other brands of Chinese medicine commonly contain 200 pills of standard 2:1 concentrated pills in each bottle (some pills are not even concentrated). In such cases, 8 pills are equal to only 3 grams of raw herbs, one bottle contains the equivalent of 75g of raw herbs. Therefore, one Guang Ci Tang® bottle contains the equivalent of almost 3 times the amount of raw herbs as other leading brands.
                </p>
                <p>
                When you choose Guang Ci Tang® products, you are taking advantage of a powerful fusion of modern science and ancient tradition that embraces the highest quality standards in the field of Chinese medicine today.
